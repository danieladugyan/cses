# Notes

- **Missing Number**: There was a smarter solution available using XOR.
- **Increasing Array**: I misunderstood the problem description to allow moving around elements in the array. My eventual solution could be made faster by calculating the answer while reading the input.
- **Permutations**: Very simple in the end but I still needed a hint to get there.
